# ChromePlus
I just wanted to make Chrome on Android better.

This library makes use of the [Xposed framework](https://github.com/rovo89/Xposed) on Android which allows for injecting code into other apps.

While a potential security concern, it was fun to make modifications to my favourite mobile browser (Chrome). 

## Features
Allow user to open videos in any app of their choice.
